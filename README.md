<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>i tend to go by Twig or Temmie - i'm interested in pretty much everything to do with computers, including but not limited to micro controllers, general circuitry, artificial intelligence, game dev, cyber security, and just about anything linux related; i have a long lasting tendency to play bad apple on anything i can get my hands on, ranging from minecraft to a lego EV microcontroller</p>
<p>i have a secondary <a href=https://github.com/orgs/JustTemmiesRandomProjects>github page</a> packed with random 1-off projects; anything i don't want to clutter my main profile with, you might find something nifty on it!</p>
