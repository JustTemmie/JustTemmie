<h1 align="left">Hi 👋</h1>

<p>I tend to go by Twig or Temmie - According to my university i study "information technology" and "computer systems", it's a fairly accurate label as i'm interested in pretty much anything electronic, including but not limited to micro controllers, general circuitry, artificial intelligence (the moral kind), game dev, cyber security, and just about anything linux related; i have a long lasting tendency to play bad apple on anything i can get my hands on, ranging from minecraft to a lego EV microcontroller</p>
<p>I have a secondary <a href=https://github.com/orgs/JustTemmiesRandomProjects>github page</a> packed with random 1-off projects; anything i don't want to clutter my main profile with, you might find something nifty on it!</p>
